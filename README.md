# Flipkart Smartphone Web Scraping Project

## Project Overview

This project focuses on extracting data about top smartphones available on Flipkart using web scraping techniques. The data extracted includes product names, descriptions, prices, and ratings, which are stored in a CSV file for further data analysis. The project demonstrates the use of Python modules like BeautifulSoup and requests to navigate and scrape data from a website.

## Files Included

- **`Flipkart web scraping.ipynb`**: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code used to scrape the data from Flipkart. It includes detailed steps and explanations of the web scraping process.
- **`flipkart.csv`**: This CSV file contains the extracted data, including the product name, description, price, and ratings of the top smartphones available on Flipkart.

## Requirements

To run the code provided in this project, you will need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- `requests`
- `BeautifulSoup4`
- `pandas`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
pip install pandas
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Open the Jupyter Notebook**: Open `Flipkart web scraping.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Flipkart\ web\ scraping.ipynb
   ```

3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the cells in the notebook to perform web scraping and save the data into `flipkart.csv`.

4. **Analyze the Data**: Once the data is extracted and saved in `flipkart.csv`, you can perform various data analysis tasks using Python or any other data analysis tools.

## Data Analysis

The `flipkart.csv` file contains the following columns:

- **Product Name**: The name of the smartphone.
- **Description**: A brief description of the smartphone.
- **Price**: The price of the smartphone.
- **Ratings**: The average rating of the smartphone.

You can use this data to perform various analyses, such as:

- Identifying the most popular smartphones based on ratings.
- Analyzing the price distribution of smartphones.
- Comparing features and prices of different smartphones.

## Challenges

Web scraping from a dynamic website like Flipkart requires a good understanding of HTML structure and data extraction techniques. Handling potential issues such as pagination, JavaScript-loaded content, and request rate limits are crucial for successful data extraction.
